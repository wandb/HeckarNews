 * Step 1 - Parse the username and authentication tokens from the cookie data inside the request.
 *          Authentication will be deemed unsuccessful if any of that data is missing.
 * Step 2 - Attempt to authenticate the user using the username and authentication token.
 *          We'll use the authenticateUser() function we just created.
 * Step 3 - Handle the result of the authentication request.
 *          Return the following data based on whether or not authentication was a success:
 *          - userSignedIn: boolean value indicating if authentication was successful.
 *          - username: username of the user.
 *          - karma: current karma count for the user.
 *          - containsEmail: boolean value indicating whether or not the user has added an email to their account.
 *          - showDead: boolean indicating if the user has chosen to see dead items and comments.
 *          - If authentication was not successful, those values will be set to either null or false.
